# Bioinformatics - Crash Course
## Learning Objectives
By the end of today's course, you will understand the following:
 - What is nanopore sequencing?
 - What does raw read data look like?
 - What are important file formats as a bioinformatician?
 - How can I basecall, align, and interpret sequencing results from raw read data?

## Introduction
Bioinformatics is often a 'black box' of information where there are many things to learn and unpack, even as a bioinformatician! There are so many facets to the field of bioinformatics, everything from protein analytics, to spatial transcripomics, to metagenomic analysis, to pipeline engineering, there is no end to what you can learn. However, having at least some understanding of the field and how to learn field-specific tools can hopefully provide a foundation for continued learning. Let's get started!

## What is nanopore sequencing?
Nanopore seqencing relies on passing a single strand of DNA through a nanometer-scale pore, typically a biological protein pore, and measuring the changes in electrical current as the nucleotides move through the pore. The following steps and graphic outline how seqeucnign works at a surface level:
1. Preparation of the sample: The DNA or RNA sample is typically fragmented into smaller pieces before sequencing.
2. Passage through nanopores: A nanopore is embedded in a membrane, and an electrical potential is applied across this membrane. As the DNA or RNA molecule passes through the nanopore, the changes in electrical current are recorded.
3. Current modulation: Each nucleotide has a distinct size and shape, leading to different current modulations as they pass through the pore. By analyzing these changes in current, the sequence of the DNA or RNA molecule can be determined.

Nanopore sequencing has several advantages:
1. Long reads: It can produce long sequence reads, which is beneficial for assembling complex genomes and resolving repetitive regions.
2. Real-time sequencing: The sequencing process is real-time, meaning that data can be generated as the DNA or RNA passes through the nanopore.
3. Single-molecule sequencing: Each molecule is sequenced individually, which can provide more accurate information compared to some other sequencing methods.

## Important file formats for today
### POD5 / FAST5
POD5 files store raw read data that is generated by the sequencing machine. This file is not super useful until after basecalling, or interpreting the signal data into bases. 
POD5 = Newer
FAST5 = Older
### SAM / BAM
A SAM file, which stands for Sequence Alignment/Map format, is a standard plain-text format in bioinformatics used to store nucleotide sequence alignment information. SAM files are often generated by DNA or RNA sequencing technologies and are used to represent the alignment of sequence reads to a reference genome. BAM files are the compressed, or smaller version of SAM files. See the link for more information

### BED 
A BED file in bioinformatics is a widely used file format for representing genomic region data. The name "BED" stands for Browser Extensible Data. This format is simple and flexible, making it easy to use for storing and sharing genomic annotations.

A BED file typically contains information about genomic features such as genes, transcripts, regulatory elements, or other functional elements. Each line in the BED file represents a specific genomic region and includes several columns of information. The first three columns are mandatory, and additional columns can be included for additional details.

### FASTA
The FASTA format is a simple and widely used text-based file format in bioinformatics for representing nucleotide or protein sequences. It is named after the software package "FASTA," which introduced this format. FASTA files typically have a .fasta or .fa file extension.

A FASTA file consists of one or more sequence entries, where each entry has two parts: Header Line (starting with '>') and Sequence Data

### VCF
A VCF (Variant Call Format) file is a standard file format in bioinformatics used to store information about genetic variants discovered during DNA sequencing. Genetic variants can include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural variations. VCF files are commonly used in the analysis and sharing of genomic variation data.

## Basecalling
Here we will install all of the necessary hardware to basecall on your own machine. We will be using Oxford Nanopore's open source basecalling software, Dorado. Continue on the link below and click on your operating system to download Dorado. This link can also be used later to access Dorado's in-depth documentation. 

[Dorado](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado/tree/master#installation)

Once that has been downloaded, we will get it set up to easily use in your terminal. Open the terminal and enter in these commands.
```
export PATH="/path/to/dorado/bin:$PATH"
dorado
```
You should see this pop up: 
```
Usage: dorado [options] subcommand

Positional arguments:
aligner
basecaller
demux
download
duplex
summary

Optional arguments:
-h --help               shows help message and exits
-v --version            prints version information and exits
-vv                     prints verbose version information and exits
```
Now we want to download a basecalling model. These models are ML models that are pre-trained to detect certain patterns in the raw read data to determine what base each signal is. We can download all possible models by entering the following: 
```
dorado download --model all
```
However to cut down storage, we will just download the following model, which works with methylation and should fit all needs in the lab. 
```
dorado download --model dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v4.2.0
```
Now we are ready to begin basecalling! We can do this by entering this command
```
dorado basecaller dna_r10.4.1_e8.2_400bps_hac@v4.1.0 pod5s/ > calls.bam
```
pod5s/ will be replaced with the directory of your POD5 files and calls.bam will need to be pointing to the correct output directory. 

### Alignment
Alignment can also be done with Dorado, as the Nanopore aligner [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) is integrated. 
First, we need to get our reference genome. You will need to find whatever suits your needs best, but we will use HG38, as that is the current human genome standard.
Second, align!
```
dorado aligner <index> <reads> > calls.aln.bam
```
index is the location of your reference genome and reads will be your unalinged BAM file we created while basecalling. Now you should have a basecalled, aligned BAM file filled with your sequence data!
